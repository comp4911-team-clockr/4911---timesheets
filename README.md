# 4911---timesheets

commit test - Jackee

-Fixed the DataTable and created another controller. I think somebody should Move all the Manager Classes and put it under a new Manager Package.
-NOTE CrudManagers are not Controllers.
-We should also consider moving the access java classes to be in the controllers.
-Modified the persistence.xml to include more models such as Timesheet and TimesheetRows.
